# Game Design Patterns
A study on game design patterns and their implementation.

## Resources
The following examples are based on the book *Game Programming Patterns* by Robert Nystr√∂m and is available to read online for free at https://gameprogrammingpatterns.com. The examples make use of the Python module *Pygame* which is a lightweight wrapper for the SDL library, more info of the module is available at https://www.pygame.org/news.

## Code Requirements
In order to provide with a great learning experience each example follow these specific rules:
* Implemented with as little code as possible.
* Include a before and after version.
* Well structured and documented.
* Written exclusively in Python 3.10.
* No extrnal library except Pygame.
